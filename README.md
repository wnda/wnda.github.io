I wrote the Perl script to generate the blog article pages, and their AMP counterparts, from a template document. A JSON feed and an RSS/XML feed are also generated by this script.

A Service Worker is also deployed to optimise caching in the latest Chrome/Firefox browser releases, as well as to offer an offline page with contact information.
